    "## Concluding remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The term ‘optimal policy’, which pervades an important applied monetary economics literature, means different things under different timing protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the ‘static’ Ramsey timing protocol (i.e., choose a sequence once-and-for-all), we obtain a unique plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the phrase ‘optimal policy’ seems to fit well, since the Ramsey planner optimally reaps early benefits from influencing the private sector’s beliefs about the government’s later actions\n",
    "\n",
    "When we adopt the sequential timing protocol associated with credible public policies, ‘optimal policy’ is a more ambiguous description\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a multiplicity of credible plans\n",
    "\n",
    "True, the theory explains how it is optimal for the government to confirm the private sector’s expectations about its actions along a credible plan\n",
    "\n",
    "But some credible plans have very bad outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "These bad outcomes are central to the theory because it is the presence of bad credible plans that makes possible better ones by sustaining the low continuation values that appear in the second line of incentive constraint [(31)](#equation-ES_34)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, many have taken for granted that ‘optimal policy’ means ‘follow the Ramsey plan’ 10\n",
    "\n",
    "In pursuit of more attractive ways to describe a Ramsey plan when policy making is in practice done sequentially, some writers have repackaged a Ramsey plan in the following way\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take a Ramsey *outcome* - a sequence of endogenous variables under a Ramsey plan - and reinterpret it (or perhaps only a subset of its variables) as a *target path* of relationships among outcome variables to be assigned to a sequence of policy makers 11  \n",
    "- If appropriate (infinite dimensional) invertibility conditions are satisfied, it can happen that following the Ramsey plan is the *only* way to hit the target path 12  \n",
    "- The spirit of this work is to say, “in a democracy we are obliged to live with the sequential timing protocol, so let’s constrain policy makers’ objectives in ways that will force them to follow a Ramsey plan in spite of their benevolence” 13  \n",
    "- By this slight of hand, we acquire a theory of an *optimal outcome target path*  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This ‘invertibility’ argument leaves open two important loose ends:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. implementation, and  \n",
    "1. time consistency  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As for (1), repackaging a Ramsey plan (or the tail of a Ramsey plan) as a\n",
    "target outcome sequence does not confront the delicate issue of *how* that\n",
    "target path is to be implemented 14\n",
    "\n",
    "As for (2), it is an interesting question whether the ‘invertibility’ logic\n",
    "can repackage and conceal a Ramsey plan well enough to make policy makers\n",
    "forget or ignore the benevolent intentions that give rise to the time\n",
    "inconsistency of a Ramsey plan in the first place\n",
    "\n",
    "To attain such an optimal output path, policy makers must forget their\n",
    "benevolent intentions because there will inevitably occur temptations to\n",
    "deviate from that target path, and the implied relationship among variables\n",
    "like inflation, output, and interest rates along it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark** The continuation of such an optimal target path is not an optimal target path\n",

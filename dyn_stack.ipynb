    "\n",
    "These problems  have the following features\n",

    "- The Stackelberg leader has distinct optimal decision rules at time $ t=0 $, on the one hand, and at times $ t \\geq 1 $, on the other hand  \n",
    "- The Stackelberg leader’s decision rules for $ t=0 $ and $ t \\geq 1 $ have distinct state variables  \n",
    "- Variables that encode *history dependence* appear in optimal decision rules of the  Stackelberg leader at times $ t \\geq 1 $  \n",

    "Footnotes1The problem assumes that there are no cross products between states and controls in the return function.  A simple transformation  converts a problem whose return function has cross products into an equivalent problem that has no cross products. For example, see [[HS08]](zreferences.ipynb#hansensargent2008) (chapter 4, pp. 72-73).\n",
